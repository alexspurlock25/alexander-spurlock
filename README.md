My personal website using React. Using Vite as well. Still a work in progress


## Plans
- [x] Home Page
  - [x] About me
- [ ] Projects Page
  - [ ] GitHub API
  - [ ] Upload my old projects from college
- [ ] Dev Blog Page?
  - [ ] Maybe in each project, you can click on it, then be redirected to a blog about that project
